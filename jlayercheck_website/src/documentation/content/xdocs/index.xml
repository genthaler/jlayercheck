  <body>
    <p>JLayerCheck is a tool to check module dependencies in Java programs.
    You can define groups of packages that should be a module and the allowed
    dependencies between the modules and the program will generate HTML output
    that shows an overview, which architectural violations were found, and
    generates HTML files containing the syntax-highlightes Java sources, where
    the problematic lines are marked.
      </p>
      <p>The program was started some days ago (May 2007) and the website is
      not complete yet. If you would like to try the program, get it from the
      subversion repository and take a look at the testcases. The program uses
      maven, so you should be able to run the testcases by executing "mvn test".
      </p>
      <p>Better documentation and more features will follow in the next days.</p>
